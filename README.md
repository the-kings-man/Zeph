Welcome!

I've been wanting to do this for a while, and have had many failed attempts. This is the core framework of an RPG, which I'll be pulling into a unity project and making a game.

Head over to the Wiki to read more about it, Projects is my brain dump of where I'm currently at, and I will be uploading whatever code I can open source.

Cheers!

I've started including the unity content in branch: Adding-Unity-Project2
